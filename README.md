Hello judges of Binary Fest.
This website was made by Daksh Leekha (alone) - 9A
I have made a website using django, boostrap, html and css. 
I have chosen a small restaurant called "The Retro Affair".

Features:
1. Responsive website
2. Easy to use admin panel (for adding new products without having to code)
3. A cart for storing items before checkout

1. Responsive Website:
    I have used bootstrap to add responsiveness to the website

2. The admin panel is for the owner/staff to add new items or delete items when they are out of stock / unavailable

    Be sure to try it out!

3. Cart:
    On viewing each items solo page, there is an option for "add to cart"
    This will add the item along with its quantity to the cart (top right on the navbar)
    Session restoration is also available (even after refreshing/closing the website the data of items in your cart will be available)

PS: Modules to be downloaded would be 'django' and 'pillow'
